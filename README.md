## by Joshua Ati

## Dataset
>The dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values  separated by pipe (|) characters.
The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.
